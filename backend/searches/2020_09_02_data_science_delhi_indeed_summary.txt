Our mission is to translate scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions. Through scientific and clinical research in Africa, India, Europe, and the U.S., IAVI is pioneering the development of biomedical innovations designed for broad global access. We develop vaccines and antibodies in and for the developing world and seek to accelerate their introduction in low-income countries. IAVI programs and partnerships are grounded in the regions of the world where the disease burden is the greatest, and our approach emphasizes sustainability. Our network of clinical research center partners in Africa and India helps strengthen in-country research capacity and supports the training and education of the next generation of scientists. The global impact of our science includes fundamental contributions to understanding the biology of HIV infection, which IAVI and others are applying toward advancing vaccine science and immunology. IAVI accelerates scientific discovery and development by fostering unique collaborations among academia, industry, local communities, governments, and funders to explore new and better ways to address public health threats that disproportionately affect people living in poverty. Our global reach, including a clinical research network in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, has allowed us to make fundamental contributions to understanding the epidemiology, transmission, virology, and immunology of HIV. This work played a key role in facilitating the design of promising HIV vaccine candidates, as well as the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are now being advanced as promising approaches for HIV prevention. Our integrated capabilities in vaccine and antibody discovery, development, and clinical research take advantage of biopharmaceutical industry expertise to accelerate the development and testing of prevention methods for HIV and other diseases. Through the Product Development Center, we support external researchers with technical and scientific expertise to accelerate the development of their own products.IAVI CORE VALUES: Dedication to the Mission:  We are committed to the translation of scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.Innovative Evolution:  We are committed to solving complex problems in creative and innovative ways, learning from our mistakes and successes and never giving upIntegrity:  We are committed to meeting the highest ethical and professional standards in everything we do and to taking responsibility for our actions to earn respectCollaboration:  We are committed to embracing diversity, the power of global teamwork and the belief that by working as one we can make a differenceDisclaimer:  Nothing in this job description restricts management's right to assign or reassign duties and responsibilities to this job at any time.

(CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org\n\nCHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States\u2019 levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.\n\nBackground\n\nThe world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\n\nProgram Overview\n\nWJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities.

(CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org\n\nCHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States\u2019 levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.\n\nBackground\n\nThe world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\n\nProgram Overview\n\nWJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities.

Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.\n\nBackground\n\nThe world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\n\nProgram Overview\n\nWJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines.

Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.\n\nBackground\n\nThe world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise.

I was also given the opportunity to learn to work on different applications and test the company's flagship platform. The team members are friendly and extremely intelligent. In addition to this, everyone is very hardworking and ever-ready to do any sort of grunt work to meet the company goals, regardless of their position in the firm. Working in such a friendly and motivating environment was an amazing experience for me!Delvin Chacko, Research Intern\nMy experience at TEAL surpassed all my expectations from the get-go. I was asked to help solve one of the most daunting problems in the Indian real estate market. Every day while working on a subset of the problem, the ideas that I brought to the table were shaped into cohesive solutions by a collaborative team effort. At TEAL I was exposed to the most cutting edge technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, ML and Data Science. The growth opportunities at TEAL are tremendous, If you are innovative and can demonstrate the will to realize your ideas, TEAL is an amazing organization to work for.Gyan Vardhan, Data Science Intern\nI had interned as a Data Scientist at Terra Economics and Analytics Lab during its early days, it was a rich learning experience working with a multi-disciplinary team who are extremely passionate about building a decision support platform for the insanely complicated realty market in India. It was exciting and challenging to work on mining huge volumes of property records; extracting patterns from the data, building data pipelines and brainstorming on building the core system. TEAL offers a very healthy work environment coupled with insanely talented people working together in an exciting setting.Naga Anjaneyulu, Data Science Intern\nI worked as a full-time Data science intern at TEAL. During this period, I got an opportunity to leverage my skillsets while also learning new technologies, working on tasks assigned to me. The company operates on the latest tech-stacks and gives opportunities to learn as much as you want. The work environment is challenging, the team at TEAL is super supportive and new ideas are always welcome.

Personally, I loved working there, my experience was fantastic!Archana Parmar, Data Science Intern\nAs a second-year college student, I was looking for an internship that would allow me to delve deeper into research and work with big data, TEAL gave me the perfect opportunity to do so, enabling me to develop proficiency in research and analysis. As a research analyst intern, I collated and cleaned data and helped in the preparation of reports and presentations, and I had members helping me at every stage of this process. This collaborative environment allowed me to cultivate my skills and also learn from my peers. The holy trinity of Rohan, Kshitij, and Shreyas served as not only excellent mentors and bosses but also as friends, helping me at every stage and giving us all food and ice cream to keep us going!Arush Mehra, Research Intern\nInternships are a crucial part of one\u2019s early career. The internship experience at TEAL was a thrilling rollercoaster ride to say the least! It was more than implementing a standard model or building an already though out concept into reality. It was about finding the solution to a unique and open-ended problem.It was exciting to work on addressing a problem with far -reaching real world applications.Moreover, the work environment had the perfect balance of casual yet professional which kept you focused and stress free at the same time. Out of every 100 startups in India only 2 of them succeed, but there are very few like TEAL India which are bound to make it big at such an early stage.Divyanshu Agarwal, NLP Intern"}
